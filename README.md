# System_Analysis_and_Design
These documents are for an online system for managing a driving school for a client ccalled DriverPass. Their goal as a business is to provide easily accessible training for people who have yet to pass the driving tests at the DMV. They wanted me to design this system to give students the opportunity to take practice test, schedule driving sessions with one of their instructors, and track their progress. 

I think I did a good job of breaking down the requirements in the business requirements document. Particularly in the performance requirements section in the nonfunctional requirements. Showing how many users I plan to support with this system and keeping account of how we are going to keep the system updated.

If I were to change anything in these documents I would likely change the use case diagram. I am certain that I have missed a few use cases in this diagram and could stand to add more.

I made sure to take what the user wanted and work into a system that meets or exceeds their needs. By considering how they envision a student using the system, and how the admins and the owner want their user accounts to work.

In the future, I would like to work more with the client and some potential end-users. The opportunity to ask them question on how they would like to use the system would give me a better understanding on what they wanted. The end-user would also give me valuable insight into what their understanding is of a system like this and what they've used in the past to try to make the user experience more familiar.
